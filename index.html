								<p class="project-intro">
									Zoom Yoga Saigon is a small Yoga Studio, full of plants and great viber. I named it Zoom because I want people to "zoom in" to see themself, to takecare their mind and their body,
									and "zoom out" to think out of the box, to discover the universal. After 4 years, Zoom Yoga has been working with over 200 womens, transfer them to become a better version of
									themself.

								<p class="project-intro">
									This project is still on paper, I am working on it now. But my main idea is to bring the healthy life style to all Vietnamese women. Thuong mobile app will change your life by
									reminding you about the good things everyday, adding in your todo list some small task. By the way, one day you will look back and see how much you already changed in your lifestyle.

							Thuong is an amazing teacher and meditation guide. She focuses on breathing techniques and understanding your body and its limits. Many yoga classes I've tried before I often have to
							stop at some points because I'm not capable of certain moves, but with Thuong I never felt stressed during the sessions, yet afterwards I could feel that my practice is deepening. Highly
							recommend!

							Thuong is unlike any other yoga teacher that I have ever had. She is extremely knowledgeable about the yoga postures, meditation and yoga as a spiritual practice. Parts of yoga that I
							was always apprehensive about, she made more accessible for me. She is a kind, fun, compassionate and fiercely dedicated teacher. I wouldn't hesitate on recommending Thuong to anybody
							from any level - beginner to advanced.
